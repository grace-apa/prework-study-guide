# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework.As boot camp students we will encounter, and conquer, many challenges along the way and one problem that students face is keeping track of the amount of information they are learning each day.

To solve this problem, I built a website that can be used as a study guide to keep track of learningns. As webpages are excellent at displaying and storing information in a user-friendly way. 

I've learnt the concepts and termonology associated with being a developer, how to think like a developer and adopt a growth mindset, practiced computational thinking, how to use the command line, set up SSJ Keys and complete a Git Flow and so much more.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
